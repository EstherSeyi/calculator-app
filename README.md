## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindcCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React framework

### What I learned

One thing I learnt on this project is the Javascript `eval()` method. I learnt about it's uses and how dangerous it could be.

### Continued development

Going forward, i'll like to improve the project by;

- Making the display area better handle larger numbers of characters responsively.
- Formating display values.
- Adding some animations.
- Writing tests.
